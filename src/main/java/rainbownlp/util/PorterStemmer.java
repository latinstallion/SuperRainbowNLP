   History:

   Release 1

   Bug 1 (reported by Gonzalo Parra 16/10/99) fixed as marked below.
   The words 'aed', 'eed', 'oed' leave k at 'a' for step 3, and b[k-1]
   is then out outside the bounds of b.

   Release 2

   Similarly,

   Bug 2 (reported by Steve Dyrdahl 22/2/00) fixed as marked below.
   'ion' by itself leaves j = -1 in the test for 'ion' in step 5, and
   b[j] is then outside the bounds of b.

   Release 3

   Considerably revised 4/9/00 in the light of many helpful suggestions
   from Brian Goetz of Quiotix Corporation (brian@quiotix.com).
